                A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole-blood components). Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (the latter called apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.
                <br />Today in the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply.
                There are four major blood groups determined by the presence or absence of two antigens – A and B – on the surface of red blood cells. In addition to the A and B antigens, there is a protein called the Rh factor, which can be either present (+) or absent (–), creating the 8 most common blood types (A+, A-,  B+, B-,  O+, O-,  AB+, AB-).

These people can donate blood to only to people having blood group A and AB. Diet for blood group A has to follow is a meat free diet which is nothing but they must be complete vegetarian. They have to take beans, legumes, fruits, vegetables, whole grains which are organically fresh. This group has sensitive immune system.

                    Blood group O is termed as blood group zero in some countries. This group does not have antigen A and antigen B on red blood cells. Even blood serum does not contain antibodies A and B also. So group O can receive blood from only people who are having blood group O. This group people can donate blood to all people of other groups as it never contains antigens and antibodies. Therefore blood group O is called as universal donors. Since blood group O is compatible to all groups.
                    <br />
                    Diet for individuals who are having blood group O to be followed is high protein diet. It includes lean meat, fish, poultry, and vegetables, lightly of grains, dairy products and beans.
